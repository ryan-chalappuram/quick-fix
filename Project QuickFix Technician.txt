Project: QuickFix – Technician Booking & Dispatch Portal 
This project simulates a real-world platform where customers can request home services (like electricians, plumbers, or appliance repair), and technicians and admins manage bookings and workflows from their respective dashboards. 
It’s a great opportunity to strengthen your skills across React, FastAPI/Django, PostgreSQL, Docker, CI/CD, and deployment, while working on a meaningful and structured real-world use case. 
What You’ll Build 
1. Customer Interface (React or Next.js) 

    Sign up / Login 
    Book a service: Choose service type, preferred date/time, add address and problem description 
    View, cancel, or reschedule existing bookings 
    Track booking status (Pending → Accepted → In Progress → Completed) 

2. Technician Dashboard 

    Login to view assigned bookings 
    Accept/reject requests 
    Update booking status (In progress / Completed) 
    View weekly schedule 

3. Admin Panel 

    View all incoming service requests 
    Assign technicians manually (or build a basic auto-assign logic) 
    Monitor job load per technician 
    Dashboard view for analytics (no. of requests, pending jobs, completion rate) 

 
Backend API 

    Build using FastAPI or Django REST Framework 
    JWT-based authentication for 3 roles: Customer, Technician, Admin 
    PostgreSQL DB with: 
        Users 
        Technicians 
        Services 
        Bookings 
    API endpoints for login, booking creation, updates, assignment, and status tracking 

 
DevOps Setup 

    Dockerize both backend and frontend 
    Set up CI using Gitlab Actions 
    Deploy the app to AWS ECS (Fargate) or Render (as a simpler option) 
    Store secrets securely using .env or AWS SSM (if ECS) 

 
Optional Enhancements (Stretch Goals) 

    Email notifications on booking creation or status changes 
    Add calendar view for technicians 
    Start building a lightweight mobile version in React Native
